        <h2>The Golden State</h2>
        <p>California, known as "The Golden State," became the 31st state in the U.S. on September 9, 1850. It’s the most populous state with over 39 million people (as of 2020) and covers 163,696 square miles, making it the third-largest state. Sacramento is the capital, located in the northern part of the state.

People have lived in California for at least 11,000 years, with Native American tribes creating unique cultures and languages. The first Europeans to explore the state were Spanish explorers led by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo in 1542. California's name likely comes from a mythical island in an old Spanish novel. Over time, California was controlled by Spain, Mexico, and then the U.S. after the Mexican-American War. The Gold Rush in 1848 brought many settlers and helped California become a state in 1850.

California has the largest economy in the U.S. and is the world’s 6th largest economy if it were its own country. It’s known for its diverse industries like technology, entertainment, agriculture, and tourism. The state has more national parks than any other state, including famous ones like Yosemite and Death Valley.

California is also famous for wine production, making 60% of the wine in the U.S. The California grizzly bear, now extinct, still appears on the state flag. The state is home to Hollywood, which became the center of the U.S. film industry in the early 1900s. With its beaches, cities, and nature, California offers something for everyone, making it a standout state in the U.S.</p>
